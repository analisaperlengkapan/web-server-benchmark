# Comprehensive Stress Testing Guide

This guide covers the advanced stress testing and resource monitoring capabilities of the web server benchmark suite.

## Overview

The stress testing suite provides comprehensive performance analysis under various load conditions, including:

- **Load Testing**: Standard performance benchmarks
- **Stress Testing**: Performance under extreme conditions

## Resource Monitoring

### CPU Usage
- **Average CPU %**: Mean CPU utilization during test
- **Peak CPU %**: Maximum CPU spike
- **Analysis**: Lower is better; indicates efficiency

### Memory Usage
- **Average Memory MB**: Mean RAM consumption
- **Peak Memory MB**: Maximum memory usage
- **Analysis**: Stable memory indicates good resource management

### Network I/O
- **RX (Receive)**: Incoming network traffic
- **TX (Transmit)**: Outgoing network traffic
- **Analysis**: Tracks data transfer efficiency

### Disk I/O
- **Block Read**: Data read from disk
- **Block Write**: Data written to disk
- **Analysis**: Indicates caching efficiency

## Running Tests

### Single Language Test

```bash
./benchmark-stress.sh <language>
```

**Example**:
```bash
./benchmark-stress.sh rust
```

### All Languages Test

```bash
./benchmark-stress-all.sh
```

This will:
1. Run all 5 test scenarios on each language
2. Monitor resources during each test
3. Generate comprehensive comparison report

1. **Results by Language**: Detailed metrics for each implementation
2. **Performance Comparison**: Rankings across all languages
3. **Resource Efficiency**: CPU and memory usage rankings
4. **Failure Analysis**: Request failure rates
5. **Recommendations**: Best performers by category

## Interpreting Results

### Performance Metrics

**Requests per Second (RPS)**
- Higher is better
- Indicates throughput capacity
- Compare across test scenarios to see scalability

**Average Latency**
- Lower is better
- Measured in milliseconds
- Key user experience metric

**Failed Requests**
- Should be 0 under normal conditions
- Indicates reliability issues if > 0
- Common causes: timeouts, connection limits

### Resource Metrics

**CPU Usage**
- **Low CPU, High RPS**: Efficient implementation
- **High CPU, Low RPS**: Inefficient processing
- **Stable CPU**: Good load distribution
- **Spiking CPU**: Possible bottlenecks

**Memory Usage**
- **Stable Memory**: No memory leaks
- **Increasing Memory**: Potential leak or poor cleanup
- **High Initial Memory**: Large startup overhead
- **Low Memory**: Efficient resource usage

### Test-Specific Insights

**Standard Load**
- Baseline for comparison
- All languages should perform well

**High Concurrency**
- Tests concurrent connection handling
- Reveals thread pool limitations
- Shows async/parallel efficiency

**Very High Load**
- Identifies maximum capacity
- Shows breaking point behavior
- Tests error handling

**Sustained Load**
- Memory leak detection
- Performance consistency
- Long-term stability

## Best Practices

### Hardware Considerations

1. **Consistent Environment**: Run all tests on same hardware
2. **Adequate Resources**: Ensure host has sufficient CPU/RAM
3. **Isolated Testing**: Close other applications during tests
4. **Cool Down**: Wait between tests for system recovery

### Test Configuration

1. **Network Limits**: Check system connection limits (ulimit)
2. **Docker Resources**: Ensure Docker has adequate memory
3. **Filesystem**: Use fast storage for I/O tests
4. **Monitoring Overhead**: Resource monitoring adds slight overhead

### Analyzing Results

1. **Compare Similar Tests**: Use same parameters for fair comparison
2. **Multiple Runs**: Run tests multiple times for consistency
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Consider variance and outliers
4. **Context Matters**: Different workloads favor different languages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Refused Errors**
- Server not fully started
- Solution: Increase wait time in script

**Too Many Open Files**
- System file descriptor limit
- Solution: `ulimit -n 65536`

**Out of Memory**
- Insufficient system resources
- Solution: Reduce concurrent connections or use larger instance

**High Failure Rates**
- Server capacity exceeded
- Solution: Adjust test parameters or optimize server config

## Example Results Interpretation

  Memory: avg=125.3MB, max=158.7MB

Analysis:
✅ High throughput (>15K RPS)
✅ Low latency (<10ms)
✅ Zero failures
✅ Efficient CPU usage (~45% average)
✅ Stable memory usage
→ Excellent performance and efficiency
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Test Parameters

Edit `benchmark-stress.sh` to customize:

```bash
# Line 96: Standard load
ab -n 10000 -c 100 ${URL}

# Modify to:
ab -n 50000 -c 250 ${URL}
```

### Additional Monitoring

Add custom monitoring scripts:

```bash
# Monitor specific metrics
docker stats ${CONTAINER_ID} --no-stream --format "table {{.CPUPerc}}\t{{.MemUsage}}"
```

### Integration with CI/CD

Run stress tests in CI pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Stress Test
  run: ./benchmark-stress.sh rust
  
- name: Upload Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: stress-test-results
    path: stress_test_results/
```

## Contributing

To add new test scenarios:

1. Add test function to `benchmark-stress.sh`
2. Update resource monitoring section
3. Add results parsing to summary generation
